# How to use shaders in the examples folder
Head over to `https://github.com/aracitdev/ShaderDesktop/releases/tag/1.0`

The source of the shaders came from the link below, with my modification.
`https://github.com/thennequin/LivingWallpaper/tree/master/Output/Presets`

My modification uses code found here:
