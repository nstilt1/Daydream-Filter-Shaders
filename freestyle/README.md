# This doesn't work
It is supposed to work with NVIDIA's Freestyle feature, but it doesn't seem to like it when I try to use a time variable. Will continue to test things out.

# Installation instructions
Enable experimental features in NVIDIA GeForce Experience
Navigate to `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Ansel`
If it doesn't exist, create it.
Then put this .fx file in there.

# Update: 1/29/2023
I am 99% sure that this will not work using NVIDIA's Freestyle. I have tried numerous ways to get the hue to modulate, and it only works when you manually modulate it in the Freestyle UI. If only it was compatible with GLSL.
