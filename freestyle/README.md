# This doesn't work yet
It is supposed to work with NVIDIA's Freestyle feature, but it doesn't seem to like it when I try to use a time variable. Will continue to test things out.

# Installation instructions
Enable experimental features in NVIDIA GeForce Experience
Navigate to `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Ansel`
If it doesn't exist, create it.
Then put this .fx file in there.
